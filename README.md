# Project-2---Counter
This is a small counter project which shows how a counter can be increased, decreased and reset by clicking any of the three available buttons.
Also, the color of the counter changes according to the specific button clicked. 

This project showcased the use of the DOM in manipulating data and the elements in a document.
